One-Stop Solution for Delegates: Automation to track voting activity & Stay up-to-date with current DAO affairs with Senate

##Inspiration
Our inspiration stems from the problems that current delegates face as they navigate through various DAOs to participate in decentralized governance.

##What it does
Senate is an all-in-one solution to enhance a delegates workflow. Initially, Senate automates tracking + managing voting activity and aggregates updates from various forums on a single page to reduce the friction of delegates' work.

With the automated vote tracker, we help delegates track all their voting activities across different protocols to not only manage their workload but also take a step back to understand how much they have spent voting at a protocol. This voting tracker can also be used as one of a few factors to help determine a delegate's compensation rate.

For the forum dashboard, delegates can stay up-to-date with current DAO affairs without hopping across forums separately. Less tabs, less stress.

##How we built it
We aggregated the data from snapshot and discourse forms to showcase how delegates can view proposals and votes in a single page. We used typescript and react on the front-end and graphQL to fetch the discourse data.

##Challenges we ran into
Time: We didn't have enough time to develop specially for the frontend Data: each protocol's forum has a different json format

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are a somewhat last-minute entry to the hackathon but we managed to focus on our two main features and ship a product we are proud of.

##What we learned
Continuous communication between the team is essential for success. Even having one or two meetings a day to discuss the progress helped a lot. Task management and Time management are one of the most essential things for succeeding hackathon.

##What's next for Senate
Trello-like dashboard for organisations or groups to separate individuals and their protocols. I.E Bobby handles optimism and balancer etc, steve handles maker and Aave etc.

Ability to track current active proposals & Draft responses to forum discussions or votes

Show voting power, amount of delegators, link to delegate thread

Categorize votes by the person who handled that voting interaction (i.e. Bobby voted optimism)
